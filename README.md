# The Semantics of Educational Representation

<!-- About -->
## About

This repo contains code for my exam project in the course *political data science*. The aim of the project was two-fold:

1. Empirically I investigate whether MPs with a given educational background tend to represent this level of education more in their parlamenteray speeches.
2. Methodologically, I estimate paragraph vectors at the speech-level and project these onto a constructed semantic dimension meant to represent educational representation. The idea is that this projection can be used as measure of the level and direction of educational representation in any given speech.

I employ this method on all parliamentary speeches in the Danish parliament from 1997 to 2024 (more than 500k speeches). In summary, I don't really find any difference in speech. However, I still believe that this could be a valid measurement technique (in the paper I find that it has reasonably high face validity). However, it definitely needs more work than what I had the time for here.

Please feel free to use the code - but do put a reference my way if you do. And by all means, reach out with any questions or comments!

## Files

As of right now the repo only contains code and plots, and unfortunately no data, as the files are too large for GitHub. However the dataset used can be assembled by using the provided code (and merging it with the ParlSpeech dataset).
